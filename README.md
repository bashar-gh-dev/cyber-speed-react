Hello, my name is Bashar.
I really appreciate this opportunity, and I look forward to work with you.

Before you start please notice that there are no documentation for the movies api which provided in the assessment (for example there are no instructions how to use pagination), also I could not find an api for fetching random movies. As a result I was forced to use the same movies search api with empty keyword for movies list api.

How to run react application:

TODO: electron

As I am not familiar with electron (this is the first time I touch electron code), I decided to keep it in other branch: 'electron-wip'. Therefore, I am sorry that you maybe not see well structured code or best practices (only for electron branch).

If you still want to have a look into electron branch:


1- Checkout to the branch electron-wip

git checkout electron-wip


2- Re install node packages

npm install


3- Run the command: npm run dev:electron
